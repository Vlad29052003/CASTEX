## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)

## Installation

To get the eCommerce website project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/eCommerce-Website.git
    cd eCommerce-Website
    ```

2. **Build and run the Spring Boot backend:**

    - Navigate to the `backend` directory.
    - Run the following command to start the Spring Boot application:

        ```bash
        ./mvnw spring-boot:run
        ```

    - The application is configured to use the H2 in-memory database by default. You can access the H2 console to manage the database by navigating to [http://localhost:8080/h2-console](http://localhost:8080/h2-console). Use the JDBC URL `jdbc:h2:mem:testdb`, and the username and password from your `application.properties` file.

3. **Install frontend dependencies and start the development server:**

    - Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
    - Run the following commands to install dependencies and start the development server:

        ```bash
        npm install
        npm start
        ```

4. **Access the website:**

    - Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

You have now successfully installed and set up the eCommerce website project on your local machine using the H2 in-memory database. You can explore the website, test its features, and make any necessary modifications to suit your requirements.
